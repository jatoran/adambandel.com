The Valadez Vine Slideshow is a web-based family newsletter application that displays monthly photo collections and includes a special video feature. The project consists of:

1. A main page (index.html) that hosts the slideshow functionality.

2. A separate page (rachel.html) for displaying a specific video.

3. A JavaScript file (script.js) that handles the slideshow logic, navigation, and audio playback.

4. A CSS file (style.css) for styling and responsiveness.

5. A JSON file (slideshow_data.json) that contains the data structure for images, audio, and video content organized by month.

Key features:

- Monthly navigation allowing users to switch between different photo collections.

- Slideshow controls (play, pause, next, previous) for image navigation.

- Audio playback synchronized with each month's slideshow.

- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile viewing.

- A special video page accessible from the main navigation.

- Image preloading option for performance optimization.

- Fallback mechanisms for handling missing or unloadable content.

The application is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages, making it easily accessible to family members. It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and sharing family memories through photos and videos, organized chronologically.
