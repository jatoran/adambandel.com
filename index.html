                    <p id="historyContent5Anchor1">542 to 251 million years ago<br><strong>PALEOZOIC ERA</strong><br>The Paleozoic is a time in Earth's history when complex life forms evolved, took their first breath of oxygen on dry land, and when the forerunners of all life on Earth
                        began to diversify. </p>
                    <p>541 - 485 million years ago<br> Cambrian Period<br> The Cambrian sparked a rapid expansion in evolution in an event known as the Cambrian Explosion, during which the greatest number of creatures evolved in a single period in the history
                        of Earth. Plants like algae evolved, and the fauna was dominated by armored arthropods, such as trilobites. Almost all marine phyla evolved in this period. During this time, the super-continent Pannotia began to break up, most
                        of which later recombined into the super-continent Gondwana.</p>
                    <p>485 - 440 million years ago<br> Ordovician Period<br> The Ordovician was a time in Earth's history in which many species still prevalent today evolved, such as primitive fish, cephalopods, and coral. The most common forms of life,
                        however, were trilobites, snails and shellfish. More importantly, the first arthropods crept ashore to colonize Gondwana, a continent empty of animal life. By the end of the Ordovican, Gondwana was at the south pole, and early
                        North America had collided with Europe, closing the Atlantic Ocean. Glaciation of Africa resulted in a major drop in sea level, killing off all life that had established life along coastal Gondwana. Glaciation caused a snowball
                        Earth, leading to the Ordovician-Silurian extinction, during which 60% of marine invertebrates and 25% of families became extinct. This is considered the first mass extinction and the second deadliest in the history of Earth.</p>
                    <p>440 - 415 million years ago<br> Silurian Period<br> The Silurian saw the transition of the Earth from the Snowball Earth. This period saw the mass evolution of fish, as jaw-less fish became more numerous, jawed fish evolved, and the
                        first freshwater fish evolved, though arthropods, such as sea scorpions, remained the apex predators. Fully terrestrial life evolved, which included early arachnids, fungi, and centipedes. Also, the evolution of vascular plants
                        (Cooksonia) allowed plants to gain a foothold on land. These early terrestrial plants are the forerunners of all plant life on land. During this time, there were four continents: Gondwana (Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica,
                        India), Laurentia (North America with parts of Europe), Baltica (the rest of Europe), and Siberia (Northern Asia). The recent rise in sea levels provided new habitats for many new species.</p>
                    <p>415 - 360 million years ago<br> Devonian Period<br> Also known as "The Age of the Fish", the Devonian features a huge diversification in fish, including armored fish like Dunkleosteus and lobe-finned fish which eventually evolved into
                        the first tetrapods. On land, plant groups diversified incredibly in an event known as the Devonian Explosion during which the first trees evolved, as well as seeds. This event also allowed the diversification of arthropod life
                        as they took advantage of the new habitat. The first amphibians also evolved, and the fish were now at the top of the food chain. Near the end of the Devonian, 70% of all species became extinct in an event known as the Late Devonian
                        extinction, which is the second mass extinction known to have happened.</p>
                    <p>60 - 300 million years ago<br> Carboniferous Period<br> During this period, average global temperatures were exceedingly high: the early Carboniferous averaged at about 20 degrees Celsius (but cooled to 10 degrees during the Middle
                        Carboniferous). Tropical swamps dominated the Earth, and the large amounts of trees created much of the carbon that became coal deposits. Also, the first reptiles and synapsids evolved in the swamps.</p>
                    <p>300 - 251 million years ago<br> Permian Period<br> At its beginning, all continents came together to form the super-continent Pangaea, surrounded by one ocean called Panthalassa. The Earth was very dry during this time, with harsh
                        seasons, as the climate of the interior of Pangaea wasn't regulated by large bodies of water. Reptiles and synapsids flourished in the new dry climate. Creatures such as Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus ruled the new continent. The
                        first conifers evolved, then dominated the terrestrial landscape. Nearing the end of the period, Scutosaurus and gorgonopsids filled the empty desert. Eventually, they disappeared, along with 95% of all life on Earth in the Permian–Triassic
                        extinction, the world's third mass extinction event.</p>

                    <p> 250 - 247 million years ago<br> The Early Triassic was dominated by deserts as Pangaea had not yet broken up, thus the interior was arid. The Earth had just witnessed a massive die-off in which 95% of all life became extinct.</p>
                    <p>247 - 237 million years ago<br> The Middle Triassic featured the beginnings of the breakup of Pangaea, and the beginning of the Tethys Sea. The ecosystem had recovered from the devastation of the Great Dying. Reptiles began increasing
                        in size.Meanwhile, on land, pine forests flourished, as well as mosquitoes and fruit flies. The first ancient crocodilians evolved, which sparked competition with the large amphibians that had since rule the freshwater world.</p>
                    <p> 237 - 200 million years ago<br> Following the bloom of the Middle Triassic, the Late Triassic featured frequent rises of temperature, as well as moderate precipitation (10-20 inches per year). The recent warming led to a boom of reptilian
                        evolution on land as the first true dinosaurs evolved, as well as pterosaurs. The climactic change, however, resulted in a large die-out known as the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event, in which all archosaurs (excluding ancient
                        crocodiles), synapsids, and almost all large amphibians became extinct, as well as 34% of marine life in the fourth mass extinction event.</p>
                    <p>200 - 145 million years ago<br> JURASSIC PERIOD</p>
                    <p>200 - 175 million years ago<br> The climate was much more humid than the Triassic, and as a result, the world was very tropical. In the oceans, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs and ammonites dominanted the seas. On land, dinosaurs and other
                        reptiles dominated the land, with species such as Dilophosaurus at the apex. The first true crocodiles evolved, pushing the large amphibians to near extinction. The reptiles rose to rule the world. Meanwhile, the first true mammals
                        evolved, but never exceeded the height of a shrew.</p>
                    <p>175 - 163 million years ago<br> During this epoch, reptiles flourished as huge herds of sauropods, such as Brachiosaurus and Diplodicus, filled the fern prairies of the Middle Jurassic. Many other predators rose as well, such as Allosaurus.
                        Conifer forests made up a large portion of the world's forests. In the oceans, plesiosaurs were quite common, and ichthyosaurs were flourishing. This epoch was the peak of the reptiles.</p>
                    <p> 163 - 145 million years ago<br> The Late Jurassic featured a massive extinction of sauropods and ichthyosaurs due to the separation of Pangaea into Laurasia and Gondwana in an extinction known as the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction.
                        Sea levels rose, destroying fern prairies and creating shallows. Ichthyosaurs became extinct whereas sauropods, as a whole, did not; in fact, some species, like Titanosaurus, lived until the K-T extinction. The increase in sea-levels
                        opened up the Atlantic sea way which would continue to get larger over time. The divided world would give opportunity for the diversification of new dinosaurs.</p>
                    <p>145 - 66 million years ago<br> CRETACEOUS PERIOD</p>
                    <p>145 - 100 million years ago<br> The Early Cretaceous saw the expansion of seaways, and as a result, the decline and extinction of sauropods (except in South America)</p>
                    <p>100 - 65 million years ago<br> The Late Cretaceous featured a cooling trend that would continue into the Cenozoic Era. Eventually, tropical ecology were restricted to the equator and areas beyond the tropic lines featured extreme seasonal
                        changes of weather. Dinosaurs still thrived as new species such as Tyrannosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Triceratops and Hadrosaurs dominated the food web. At the end of the Cretaceous, the Deccan Traps and other volcanic eruptions were
                        poisoning the atmosphere. As this was continued, it is thought that a large meteor smashed into earth, creating the Chicxulub Crater creating the event known as the K-T Extinction, the fifth and most recent mass extinction event,
                        during which 75% of life on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. Every living thing with a body mass over 10 kilograms became extinct, and the age of the dinosaurs came to an end.</p>
                    <p id="historyContent5Anchor3">66 million years ago - present<br><strong>CENOZOIC ERA</strong>
                        <Br>The Cenozoic featured the rise of mammals as the dominant class of animals, as the end of the age of the dinosaurs left significant evolutionary vacuums.</p>
                    <p>66 - 23 million years ago<br> PALEOGENE PERIOD</p>
                    <p> 66 - 56 million years ago<br> Paleocene Epoch<br> The Paleocene Epoch began with the K-T extinction event caused by the impact of a metorite in the area of present day Yucatan Peninsula and caused the destruction of 75% of all species
                        on Earth. The Early Paleocene saw the recovery of the Earth from that event. The continents began to take their modern shape, but all continents (and India) were separated from each other. Afro-Eurasia was separated by the Tethys
                        Sea, and the Americas were separated by the strait of Panama, as the Isthmus of Panama had not yet formed. Mammals were still quite small.</p>
                    <p> 56 - 34 million years ago<br> Eocene Epoch<br> In the early Eocene, land animals were small and living in cramped jungles, much like the Paleocene. None had a mass over 10 kilograms. Among them were early primates, whales and horses
                        along with many other early forms of mammals. At the top of the food chains were huge birds, such as Gastornis. It is the only time in recorded history that birds ruled the world (excluding their ancestors, the dinosaurs). The
                        late Eocene Epoch saw the rebirth of seasons, which caused the expansion of savanna-like areas, along with the evolution of grass.</p>
                    <p> 33 - 23 million years ago<br> Oligocene Epoch<br> The Oligocene featured the expansion of grass which had led to many new species to take advantage, including the first elephants, cats, dogs, marsupials and many other species still
                        prevalent today. Many other species of plants evolved during this epoch also, such as the evergreen trees.</p>
                    <p> 23 - 3 million years ago<br> NEOGENE PERIOD</p>
                    <p>23 - 5 million years ago<br> Miocene Epoch<br> It is a period during which grass spread further, effectively dominating a large portion of the world, and diminished forests in the process. Apes thrived, and evolved into a staggering
                        30 species. Overall, arid and mountainous land dominated most of the world, as did grazers. The Tethys Sea finally closed with the creation of the Arabian Peninsula and in its wake left the Black, Red, Mediterranean and Caspian
                        Seas. This only increased aridity. Many new plants evolved, and 95% of modern seed plants evolved in the mid-Miocene</p>
                    <p>5 - 3 million years ago<br> Pliocene Epoch<br> The Pliocene featured dramatic climactic changes, which ultimately led to modern species and plants. The most dramatic are the formation of Panama Ishtmus, and the accumulation of ice
                        at the poles, leading to a massive die-off, India and Asia collided forming the Himalayas, the Rockies and Appalachian mountain ranges were formed, and the Mediterranean Sea dried up for the next several million years. Along with
                        these major geological events, Australopithecus evolved in Africa, beginning the human branch. Animals took advantage of the Isthmus of Panama, to migrate between North and South America, wreaking havoc on the local ecology. Climactic
                        changes brought savannas that continue to spread across the world, Indian monsoons, deserts in East Asia, and the beginning of the Sahara desert. The Earth's continents and seas moved into their present shapes, and the world land
                        masses have not changed much since</p>

                        <Br>Features modern animals and dramatic climate changes.</p>
                    <p>3 million - 12,000 years ago<br> Pleistocene Epoch<br> This epoch featured the ice ages that resulted from the cooling effect that started in the Mid-Eocene Epoch of the Paleogene Period. As the ice progressively migrated towards the
                        equator, the area outside of the tropic lines featured intense winters yet mild summers. Meanwhile, Africa experienced intense droughts, which resulted in the creation of the Sahara, Namib, and Kalahari deserts. To cope, many animals,
                        including mammoths, giant ground sloths, dire wolves, evolved and most famously Homo sapiens. The worst droughts of Africa ended 100,000 years ago, and marked the expansion of primitive man. As the Pleistocene Epoch drew to a close,
                        one of the largest die-outs caused many mega-fauna to die off, including the last hominid species (excluding Homo sapiens). </p>
                    <p>12,000 years ago - present day<br> Holocene Epoch<br> All recorded history and "the history of the world" lie within the boundaries of the Holocene epoch. Human activity, however, is being blamed for a die-out that has been progressing
                        since 10,000 B.C.E. commonly referred to as "the Sixth Extinction" at an extinction rate of 140,000 species per year.</p>
