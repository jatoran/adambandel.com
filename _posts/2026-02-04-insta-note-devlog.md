**Insta note** is a quick-capture app I built for *instant* note entry--open it, keyboard pops, type, done. It's the "no ceremony" pipeline for getting thoughts out of my head and into a safe place.

## What it does

- **Fast note entry** as the entire point of the product
- **Google OAuth** for sign-in (simple, familiar, low friction)
- A **slim widget** that immediately launches the keyboard + a text input (straight to the action)

## Core workflow (the whole philosophy)

I wanted **quick notes to myself**, and I refused to let it get bloated. No fluff. No extra steps. Just speed. It's *very simple* and *super fast* because that's the only thing I actually care about in this context.

## Sharing / capture pipeline

It also supports **share context from other apps**, so I can capture inputs coming from anywhere:

- Send **links**
- Send **photos**
- Send basically **anything**

...and route it to **my own email immediately**.

## Reality check: does it work?

Yes. This is the rare case where what I wanted is exactly what it gives me: **fast note entry**, period. I use it constantly--every day--to send myself notes.
