## Why this exists

I've used the Toby Tabs extension for years because it's genuinely great for corralling tab chaos: deep dives, tool work, project switching, saving "topic bundles" so I can close a mess and come back later. 

Then sometime in 2024 they started deprecating features to force people onto a paid Pro plan. I'm not having it. Chrome extensions are a joke to create, and I'm not getting squeezed for a workflow I rely on. 

## The decision

So I built my own: **Tab Collection Manager (TCM)**. It was easy. It took **one day**. 

## What TCM does (and what it deliberately doesn't)

**Feature parity:** It covers basically everything I used Toby for—saving tab groups/collections and restoring them later. 

**The intentional omission:** No sync (yet). I *could* build it, but I didn't care enough to take on the trade-offs at the time. 

## Current status

* **Faster/snappier than Toby**, and honestly better than a lot of other tab collection extensions because they get bloated with "features" until they're ridiculous. 
* It's live on the Chrome Web Store, usable as-is. 
* **Known rough edge:** export is a little wonky and one export button doesn't work, but you *can* export everything. 
* **Maybe later:** a couple extra features I'd like to add, basically "one cloud code session" worth of work—I just haven't felt like it because it already does what I need perfectly. 

## Why I'm not trying to monetize it

I made this for me (and future-me). Tools like this should be "made for yourself," and it's only getting easier—won't be long before even non-devs can crank out simple extensions. 

That said: I *do* want more eyes on my tools, even without charging. Visibility buys connections and goodwill, and I like knowing something I made is useful in someone else's toolbox. 

## Rant

This is exactly why it angers me: the greed is rampant, and everyone tries to monetize everything. 

And shame on Toby for taking advantage of long-time users—especially the "turn off your ability to access your tabs/collections on a deadline" move instead of leaving people on a legacy plan (or at minimum letting them keep access to what they already saved). That's not "business," that's just bad tactics and greed. 

End.
